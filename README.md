# DapperAutomapperDemo

This contains a sample project using both Dapper & AutoMapper.

The SQL folder contains a couple of T-SQL scripts. The scripts creates tables & data used in the example. (I used SQL Server 2019 Dev Ed.)

There is also a script that will convert the tables into VB Classes. If you want to play with the system then just replace the Calss starteding with <Table XXXX> ... End Class with the output of the script's query windom. I used SSMS to do this.

PLEASE NOTE THIS IS NOT INTENDED TO REPLACE EF BUT RATHER REMIND ME HOW I GOT THINGS WORKING.
