# DapperAutomapperDemo

This contains a sample project using both Dapper & AutoMapper.

The SQL folder contains a couple of scripts. The scripts creates tables & data used in the example.

There is also a script that will convert the tables into VB Classes.

PLEASE NOTE THIS IS NOT INTENDED TO REPLACE EF BUT RATHER REMIND ME HOW I GOT THINGS WORKING.
